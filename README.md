## Key Java 8 Features
#### This project utilizes  the following features introduced in Java 8 for enhanced readability and efficiency:

**Lambda Expressions and Functional Interface :-** Enable concise representation of anonymous functions, reducing boilerplate code for functional interfaces.

**Stream API :-**  Provides a functional approach to process data collections with operations like filter, map, and reduce, supporting parallel execution.

**Default Methods & Static Methods in Interfaces :-** Allows adding methods with implementation to interfaces without breaking existing code.

**Date and Time API (java.time) :-** Offers a modern, immutable, and thread-safe framework for date and time manipulation.

**Optional Class :-** A container to handle the potential absence of a value, helping to prevent NullPointerException errors.

**Method References:-** A shorthand syntax for lambda expressions that refer to existing methods by name using ::.
